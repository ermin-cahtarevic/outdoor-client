The project is based on a mobile web app that contains listings of houses, apartments, rooms etc. That was the base idea for the project.
The original theme was just an example, for this project I decided to build an app that lists hosted outdoor activities.

On the Home page, when you first enter the app, you can see a short description of the app. Through there you can either sign in or sign up to access the listings.

When logged in, the Home page shows all of the listings, from there you can access the Listing Details page or the Favourites page.

In the Listing Details page you can see the full details for that activity - title, description, host, host rating, price of the activity and the location.

From the Details page you can also add that particular listing to your list of Favourites, or remove it.

#### The frontend of the app is built with React and Redux, and the backend is an API built with Ruby on Rails
